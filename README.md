# Durak
No longer a simple command line durak game. 
Using LWJGL (poorly) this is a durak simulator.

Implementation is basic and requires a good deal of code optimisation and refactoring.

# Building
Requires lwjgl (2.8.4 is what I use) and matthissmann's TWL
You must move the res folder to the running directory.
